# Meta Game -- Taking Risk
Taking more risk 

Capital allocation

Bankroll dictates what events you can play, how many chances, etc. 
Calibrating risk, not taking risk is big risk 

adverse selection is one of the biggest / most interesting things you end up thinking about talking a lot about in trading that's unintuitive to 'normal' people - but poker is a fun case where it does tend to be intuitive; it's very easy to understand that if your opponent bets that tells you something about their hand (even if it's not intuitive exactly what you should do as a result).

If you spend a year or two running a startup and it fails, it’s not a big deal - the job at Google or McKinsey is still there at the end of it anyway. The potential upside is that you create a product that millions of people use and earn enough money that you never have to work again if you don’t want to.
