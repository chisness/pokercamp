I think that, if you had only five minutes with a world-class trader, and you asked her “teach me the essentials of trading,” probably she would spend the five minutes on adverse selection. The essential lesson is that, if you are being offered a trade, that probably means it’s a bad trade; your job is to understand that thoroughly so you can figure out the exceptions. There are many ways to teach this lesson, but my favorite probably comes from a reader email I quoted last October, when I was writing a lot about Sam Bankman-Fried’s coin flipping at Jane Street:

This was a Susquehanna interview question 25 years ago! They made me do the math on 1000 coin flips. EV(heads) (easy), standard deviation (slightly harder), then they offered me a +EV bet on the outcome. I said “let’s go.”

They said “Wrong. If we’re offering it to you, you shouldn’t take it.”

I said “We just did the math.”

They said “We have a guy on the floor of the Amex who can flip 55% heads.”

The point here is that Susquehanna International Group employed a guy who was really good at flipping coins so they land heads, so that Susquehanna’s traders didn’t get too cocky about their bets. “I’ve done the math and this trade has positive expected value,” they will say, but then they’ll pause and remember the coin-flip guy and think “if this trade really has positive expected value, why is it being offered to me,” and they think a bit harder about it and become better traders.

The profitable trades that exist in the world are either (a) the ones you’re intimately involved in running, or (b) the ones that are inaccessible to you. There is no (c). And what’s funny about the situation in trading is that, if we were talking about just about any other industry, the very notion of a (c) would be laughable. Imagine if someone who’s good at manufacturing cars came to you and said: “Hey. I’m a profitable car-maker. If you like, I’ll let you take all the profit from my car-making skill in exchange for a small fee for me.” You would rightly suspect they’re trying to pull one over on you. So why is the situation different in trading?

During the pandemic, IM grew from a small New York operation into a global phenomenon by selling the promise that it could teach anyone, particularly teens and twentysomethings, how to become a savvy retail investor. For a one-time $275 fee and $250 a month, members had access to online courses and coaches providing trading strategies—the “Yale of forex, the Harvard of trading,” as a salesman described IM in a marketing video. When young people weren’t being invited by their friends to become budding stock market mavens, they might encounter Instagram videos showing how others had gotten rich with the IM method or hear about celebrity members, including fashion model Blac Chyna and professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. 

But at the meta level, it provides a helpful lesson in adverse selection.[2] The thing that IM Academy teaches, if you are paying attention, is “if they know so much about how to make money in financial markets, why would they teach me how to do it for just $250 a month?”

If you make it to Day 6 of the Main Event with an average chip stack, for instance, your expected value is literally several hundred thousand dollars. But your median outcome is busting out fairly soon and winning “only” five figures. A lot of the EV is concentrated on those cases when you get lucky, make the final table, and win literally millions.
