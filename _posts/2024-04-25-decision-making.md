# Meta Game -- Decision Making

“The most important question to ask before making a decision,” he told me, “is ‘What is the base rate?’”

The last principle I also remember from my Amazon days: high-velocity decision making (inside of it is another popular business aphorism: disagree and commit). This could be named "ready fire aim" or "if you don't commit, you've basically quit" or "if you don't really know, just pick and go" or something like that, but "high-velocity" is distinctive in its own sense. It's an adjective that sounds more at home in physics or in describing some sort of ammunition than it does in a corporate environment, and that helps an otherwise simple principle stand out.

Good decisions Spencer Greenberg
A good goal aims to create what you intrinsically value.
A good decision increases the chance that you achieve one of your goals.
A good habit locks in place good decisions so that future good decisions become effortless.
Your decisions are often shaped by options you didn't choose. 
Good decision-making involves noticing what you've been doing by default.
Faulty baselines can bias your decision-making.
Our psychological baselines also play an important role in decision-making (“Prospect Theory” is one example of this). If you just made a lot of money at a casino, your mental baseline may not yet have caught up to having that extra money. Hence, you view that money as above and beyond what’s normal, so you are more willing to gamble it than you would be if you came back to the casino tomorrow (after your baseline has adjusted). A way to reduce this bias is to adjust our baseline to match reality faster (though, in this case, it could have the negative side effect of making you not feel as excited about your winnings). 
There is a related bias that can occur in the opposite situation: if you’ve just lost a lot of money at a casino but not adjusted your baseline to incorporate this new state of affairs, you may take unusually risky gambles to try to win the money back (perhaps in the hopes of not having to incorporate this loss into your view of reality). This is obviously a bad idea in a gambling context, and you’d be better off adjusting your baseline to match reality instead. 


When we fall prey to the “Sunk Cost Fallacy,” we’re also failing to adjust our baselines to reality. This fallacy describes what happens when we continue with a project even when we know the future prospects of the project are bad; we don’t want to have “wasted” (or “sunk”) all the effort and resources we’ve put into it already. But if we accept reality and adjust our baseline to incorporate this loss (which has indeed already occurred), the temptation to engage in the sunk cost fallacy may be reduced (or disappear completely).


How can you use this information to become happier?
If you’re feeling bad about something, try shifting your baseline to reflect your reality by practicing the different forms of acceptance outlined above, and use gratitude to adjust your baseline below reality (so that the state of the world looks better than you might have otherwise thought).

Acting under uncertainty

If I’m deciding whether to call down a potential bluff in poker, for instance, then my intuition about my opponent’s physical demeanor will sometimes make the difference if the decision is otherwise close.

Decision theory thing
Savage's Theorem andfoundations of decision theory. 
You may have heard of the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theorem, which is commonly used to justify the use of utility functions.  But the VNM theorem assumes the use of probability.  Savage's theorem, by contrast, doesn't assume probability; rather it grounds utility and probability simultaneously.

E.g. quick decisions or decisions under pressure 
personal assistant decision maker 

Author Carole Hildebrand on making better decisions:
"Most of us have weak decision-making muscles. We do not realize what it means to make a real decision. We fail to recognize the force of change that a truly congruent, committed decision makes.
The word "decision" comes from Latin roots, with de meaning "down" or "away from" and caedere meaning "to cut." Therefore, a decision means cutting from any other possibility. A true decision means you are committed to achieving a result and cutting yourself off from any other possibility.
Committed decisions show up in two places: your calendar and your bank account. No matter what you say you value, or even think your priorities are, you have only to look at last year's calendar and bank account to see the decisions you have made about what you truly value.
See how you have reserved your time. Look at your expenditures. Those are the trails to the decisions you have made."

Opportunity cost 
"I think about decisions in three ways: hats, haircuts, and tattoos.
Meta table
Most decisions are like hats. Try one and if you don’t like it, put it back and try another. The cost of a mistake is low, so move quickly and try a bunch of hats.


Some decisions are like haircuts. You can fix a bad one, but it won’t be quick and you might feel foolish for awhile. That said, don't be scared of a bad haircut. Trying something new is usually a risk worth taking. If it doesn't work out, by this time next year you will have moved on and so will everyone else.


A few decisions are like tattoos. Once you make them, you have to live with them. Some mistakes are irreversible. Maybe you'll move on for a moment, but then you'll glance in the mirror and be reminded of that choice all over again. Even years later, the decision leaves a mark. When you're dealing with an irreversible choice, move slowly and think carefully."
