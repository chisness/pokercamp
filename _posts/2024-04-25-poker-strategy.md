Which Hands to Play
Hand Ranges
Walk through hand narrowing
Build game plan based on questions, ask yourself questions all the time. Is this spot good for me? For my hand? If yes, do this. If no, do this. 
Building a strategy, easy flop strategies, range building. e.g. 1/3 on these boards
Equity vs. range 
Range morphology – Ranges are easier to understand when you think of them as shapes.
Types of Hand Strengths (absolute vs. relative)
value, mid strength, bluffs/semi bluffs, very bad hands give up
Stack to pot ratio
Fold equity
https://blog.gtowizard.com/the-value-of-fold-equity-experiment/
The value of fold equity – Learn about the value of relative fold equity with an experimental approach.
TAG Play
Position
preflop more hands as closer to button etc
biggest thing is positions when raising against open
facing raise: position, bet size, balance
Bet Sizing
Think About What You’re Targeting with Your Bet Size
Every bet you make targets some part of your opponent’s range. By “target”, we mean those hands are indifferent between calling and folding facing your bet.
The hands you target determine your value bet thresholds. Consider how to get value and what sizing makes sense to target those parts of their range.
So how do we know what hands we’re targeting? Well, you need to look at villain’s response to a bet.
How to become a GTO Wizard
Look at Villain’s Response
It’s important to look at villain’s strategy to see how they respond. Then, ask yourself if their response is realistic and what adjustments you might make against different mistakes.
Looking at their response helps you to understand why the solution works in the first place, understand blockers, and think through your strategy.
Multiple mental models, repeat what works 
Continuation Betting
Valuing Hands
Bluffing
Facing Bets and Raises
Game Selection
Your Opponents
Common Mistakes
How good is the board for me? More nuts/less nuts
Examples	
KJs on 5h2s6hKs9c, betting on river risky cause lose when opponent check raises, assume they can make us indifferent and 
usually about 75%, bigger when draw heavy, very strong, high SPR, more vulnerable, 3bet pot smaller

Doyle Brunson’s Super System
“Poker is a game of people, That’s the most important less you should learn from my book.”
“You’ll need to get inside your opponents’ head and be able to estimate with a high degree of certainty what his check, bet or raise really means…and what hand he’s likely to be playing.”
“And that’s why there’s never going to be a computer that will play World-Class Poker. It’s a people game.”
Everyone gets same cards
Art 90%, science10%
Alertness, discipline, emotions, patience, staying poker, pay attention
TAG, willing to gamble
“So your style will be very deceiving -- it’ll get all the other players befuddled. They won’t know whether you’ve really got a hand or not. They won't know whether you're going to set them all-in or not. Because they might have to put all their money in the pot not knowing if they have the best hand…they won’t know what to do. And anytime you get your opponents in that confused situation…you’ll have an advantage over them.”
Pattern recall

## Section 1

pot odds, stack-to-pot ratio (SPR), equity, expected value, Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF), and equity realization
Thresholds value/continuation/fold
Entire range
Max EV, not necessarily winning pot
Don’t overvalue big cards and medium-strength hands
Lots of EV from nutted hands 
Start with preflop, free solutions https://app.gtowizard.com/solutions 
Variance very high, law of large numbers
Using solvers, can learn by first starting with whether to bet or not, then how often to bet, then big or small, then which cards, etc. 
Asymmetry want to bet as much as possible in polarized
Increase pot geometrically?
Medium size when more symmetric
