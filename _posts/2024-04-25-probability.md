probabilistic beliefs 

There’s a lot of reasons many have made this calculation mistake. We daydream about the universes where we get what we want. The math seems like it should be more “fair” aka “gambler’s fallacy” when it actually has no feelings. 

Martingale betting is a popular and effective way to lose all of your money. It goes like this: bet $1 on some game where your odds are 50/50 minus whatever the casino takes. If you win, go home. If you lose, double your bet. Repeat this long enough and you’re guaranteed to make a dollar eventually—unless, of course, you run out of money. Which is inevitable because bankrolls aren't infinite

Our intuition is also bad because of doubles (combinatorics). Every poker player knows we are about  35% to hit a flush draw from flop to river. But “bad math” done from scratch could erroneously show it to be ~38% (19% chance on turn and river each) 

Where did the 3% disappear to? It is lost to the times we get what we want on *BOTH* streets since the sixth diamond is superfluous.

Probability: It's essential to understand the rules of probability, expected value and standard deviation, and helpful to understand independence and the normal distribution.

Visualizing Implied odds – The value you expect to gain on future streets when you outdraw your opponent
Probabilistic evaluation
https://blog.gtowizard.com/visualizing-implied-odds/ 
Whether you like something or not like clothing to buy is not yes/no just like calling a bet in poker is not just based on percentage
Probability of 1 hand against another, probability of hand improving
Roughly higher pair against 2 lower cards is 80% 
AJ vs KJ dominated around 75% 
Two overs like KQ vs 87 around 65% 
One over like A5 vs T9 around 60% 
Suited helps a little bit
Important to have outs/live cards
Probability
Odds of rolling at least 3 if you roll 2 dice
