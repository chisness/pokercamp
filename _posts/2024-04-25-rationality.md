• anchoring (where an irrelevant number can influence our judgments)
• prospect theory (a theory of how we make judgments when there is uncertainty that incorporates a number of  biases)
• the focusing illusion (where we overemphasize the importance of whatever factor we happen to be focused on at that moment)
• the peak-end rule (where our memories of an event tend to emphasize the peak moment of greatest intensity and how the event ended)
• the planning fallacy (the common bias where people underestimate the time and cost of large projects)
• the availability heuristic (where we evaluate how frequent, likely, or important an event is based on how easily we can recall examples of it to memory)
• the representativeness heuristic (where we evaluate how likely something is to be something else based on how similar it is to a prototype or stereotype rather than incorporating all the information we have, such as base rate information)

I do have hopes that there exists a version of self-improvement and societal improvement that can enjoy runaway success and rapidly improve us as a species. Our dialectic has worked blindly so far, but if we turn it back on itself and hone it to an edge, we will quickly become capable of jumping ahead of the schedule of insights as it looks right now.

So instead of trying to answer questions, I propose a short period of focusing on getting better at answering questions by intentionally designing dialectic infrastructure and technology; why bother trying to see through the fog to the dim light far away, when the fog will be gone and the light right up close as soon as we make our dialectic recursively self-improving?

I think the problem with rationalism is that it does not take into account a lot of the non-rational factors that push people in the direction of making and believing bad arguments: anger and desire to win, need to signal affiliation with valued others, self-esteem benefits of loathing an outgroup, etc. There are not many people for whom the desire to keep their thinking up to a certain standard of fairness and correctness is a powerful motivation all by itself. The people it's sufficient motivation for tend to be pretty non-social, and unusually attracted to rules and systems.

This thought experiment is genius because it hacks a bug in life’s video game: Humans are terrible at self-awareness.

But we are great at spotting things in other people.

E.g. If your friend is in the wrong relationship, you can realize in 10 minutes what may take them 10 years.

Daniel Kahneman summarised his book on cognitive biases with the following:

“The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.” - Daniel Kahneman

Kahneman did his pioneering econ research in the 1970s and 1980s. At that time, economists really took individual rationality seriously; they viewed the hyper-rational “agents” in their models not merely as convenient mathematical approximations, but as descriptions of actual human behavior. So when a psychologist came along and started showing that humans didn’t actually behave like the agents in those models, it came as a giant shock to the foundations of the entire economics discipline.
Kahneman basically did a bunch of psychology experiments to show that human beings are bad at probability. He and his longtime coauthor Amos Tversky (who died before he could share the Nobel) showed that people make strong inferences from very small samples — for example, if you meet two nice people from Australia, you might conclude that Australians are nice in general. Kahneman called this the “law of small numbers”.
This is just one example of a more general family of fallacies called “representativeness” fallacies, which Kahneman’s experiments explored in depth. Another famous example is pattern-matching — if math professors tend to wear glasses, and you had to guess whether someone is a math professor or a waiter based on whether they wear glasses, you might guess they’re a prof. But there are a lot more waiters than profs, so your guess is a bad one — you’ve committed the statistical sin of base rate neglect.
I could keep listing examples, but you get the point. Kahneman discovered a huge number of these common human mistakes. By the time he was done, there was no doubt that human beings don’t really resemble the homo economicus of 1970s models. There are exceptions, of course — companies bidding on Google ads in online auctions tend to act pretty rational. But after Kahneman, economists always had to accept the possibility that behavioral biases might drive a wedge between their predictions and the empirical data.
That understanding helped drive the rise of empirical economics, which has been the big change in the econ field over the last three decades. There are many other reasons that econ theories need to be checked against data, but economists had put so much emphasis on rationality that a demonstration of persistent, general, predictable irrationality was an especially effective method of forcing them to think about empirics.
Ideally, though, we’d want behavioral economics to give us more than just a list of anomalies. If humans are predictably irrational, we should be able to come up with a theory that describes their irrationality. Kahneman came up with psychological theories, about where irrationality comes from in the human mind — you can read about these in his book, Thinking Fast and Slow. But he also came up with an economic theory, describing how irrationality affects decision-making. This was called prospect theory.
Prospect theory is basically a combination of two behavioral biases — loss aversion and overestimation of small probabilities. Laboratory evidence generally supports prospect theory, but applying it in the real world has proven to be very tough, for one big reason — it’s hard to know what counts as a loss in people’s minds. Do people measure gains and losses relative to what they had yesterday, what they had a year ago, or what they expected to have? It’s hard to predict.
But even though he didn’t manage to completely replace existing econ theory, Kahneman’s towering influence over the economics field is undeniable. He was an all-too-rare example of a social science researcher who can cross disciplinary boundaries and apply insights from one field to transform another.
that human reason left to its own devices is apt to engage in a number of fallacies and systematic errors, so if we want to make better decisions in our personal lives and as a society, we ought to be aware of these biases and seek workarounds. That’s a powerful and important discovery.
The most important of these, the behaviorists hold, is loss-aversion: Why, for example, does the loss of $100 hurt about twice as much as the gaining of $100 brings pleasure?
Among its myriad implications, loss-aversion theory suggests that it is foolish to check one’s stock portfolio frequently, since the predominance of pain experienced in the stock market will most likely lead to excessive and possibly self-defeating caution.

Some rational thinking move some of this into an earlier "Decision Making/Smart Thinking" section

Instrumental Rationality: the skills you need to achieve your goals. What do you value for its own sake? What are the things you want to achieve above all else, the things your other actions are stepping-stones towards? These terminal goals could be happiness, improving the world, becoming famous, anything. Now ask yourself what you did this past hour. Was it the best possible action you could have taken to achieve your goals? We help you achieve your goals by giving you tools that help you become accustomed to making plans and habits that actually work and inch you in the direction you want to go.

Epistemic rationality: the use of evidence and reason to form accurate beliefs about the world. Specific skills we will teach include Bayesian reasoning, statistics, epistemology, cognitive biases, forecasting, and building models of complex systems. We teach epistemic rationality by offering interesting and complex ideas for you to discuss, debate, and form beliefs about. We also equip you with useful ideas that help you think clearly about uncertainty and complex systems.


From https://rationalpoker.com/2011/07/30/23-cognitive-mistakes-that-make-people-play-bad-poker/ 
Ignoring evidence
Inattention is the tendency to fail to concentrate on information that could be useful for future decision making.
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.
Focusing effect is the tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event; causes error in accurately predicting the utility of a future outcome.
Availability heuristic is estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples.
Not knowing the math (Innumeracy)
Neglect of probability is the tendency to completely disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainty.
Base rate neglect is the tendency to base judgments on specifics, ignoring general statistical information.
Attitude problems
Loss aversion is people’s tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.
Self-serving bias is  the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests.
Overconfidence is the state of being more certain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence available. For example, for certain types of questions, answers that people rate as “99% certain” turn out to be wrong 40% of the time.
Negativity Bias is paying more attention to and giving more weight to negative rather than positive or neutral experiences.
Optimism bias is the tendency to be over-optimistic about the outcome of planned actions.
Superstition
Clustering illusion (Apophenia) is the tendency to see patterns where none exist.
Illusion of control is the tendency to overestimate one’s degree of influence over external events.
Gambler’s fallacy is the tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged.
Just-world phenomenon is the tendency for people to believe that the world is just and therefore people “get what they deserve.”
Frustration
Irrational escalation is the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong.
Pessimism bias is the tendency for some people, especially those suffering from depression, to overestimate the likelihood of negative things happening to them.
Projection bias is the tendency to unconsciously assume that others (or one’s future selves) share one’s current emotional states, thoughts and values.
Mis-remembering reality
Outcome bias is the tendency to judge a decision by its eventual outcome instead of based on the quality of the decision at the time it was made.
Hindsight bias is sometimes called the “I-knew-it-all-along” effect, the tendency to see past events as being predictable at the time those events happened.
Consistency bias is remembering one’s past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one’s present attitudes.
Primacy effect is the tendency to weigh initial events more than subsequent events.
Peak-end rule is how we judge our past experiences almost entirely on how they were at their peak (pleasant or unpleasant) and how they ended.
Cognitive Biases https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what_exactly_ishtml 
Gambler’s Fallacy
https://old-wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Category:Biases 
Overconfidence
Overrate own judgment and performance
Learn to find this behavior and spot it and correct it, good training ground for biases like this
Poker very sure opponent has something or that you’re better than table, gets better as you become better player
Being good means you just notice others are kind of bad (something like that) 
Outcome bias - results based
Scope insensitivity - chips matter not pots
self-serving bias
the tendency to attribute success to internal or personal factors but attribute failure to situational factors beyond our control.
Making excuses, blaming others/external factors
Shouldn’t be ashamed to be biased, should learn from it
Think about how your body feels and what goes through your mind to help realize next time
The ‘JimmyLegs Theorem’ states:
Given that the Self-Serving Bias will cause you to take credit for your successes but blame luck for your failures, you should ALWAYS assume that you made mistakes in the hand, regardless of whether or not you actually won the pot, at least until it can be categorically proven otherwise.
Hindsight Bias (ex ante, ex post)
Overestimate obviousness of events after they’ve occurred (e.g. I knew it!) 
Tries to limit emotional loss in moment of pain/embarrassment
E.g. ever claim would have known something only after knowing outcome, but wuldn’t’ have bet on it before? 
Motivated Reasoning
Sunk Cost Fallacy - protect investment, chip is not yours as soon as it is put into the pot
Frequency Illusion
Should be looking for failure mode (i.e. mistakes), otherwise keep repeating. Poker good at amplifying this due to lots of decisions.

Cost of irrationality:https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ujTE9FLWveYz9WTxZ/what-cost-for-irrationality 
I think a good addition to the rationality section would be to "steel man" instead of "straw man" positions you disagree with.
Zvi: 
It is important to note, however, that this is not the only thing poker players value. Most players to some extent value fun, however they see fun. There are those who primarily want to take risk, or pass the time, or hang out with their friends. Often one will be itching for some action, and participate far more than they themselves know they should. Many will value information about what is in your hand, or are seeking to gain experience. A few are experimenting to see what happens. A small number will even be seeking to improve their rationality. A great number will value pride. Some will seek to destroy certain opponents and help others. If you model your opponents as always seeking only to win you will end up with a poor model of their behavior, and that’s before all the biases they have!
There are also poker tournaments, in which the play continues until one person has all the chips and what matters is the order in which players lose all their chips rather than the number of chips you leave with after the game. This determines who finishes in what position, which in turn determines the prizes. Sometimes being the one left with all the chips and thereby winning is most important, sometimes it is not. Here opponents will have even more unique goals. Some will seek volatility, while others will seek survival. Some will want to make sure they win at least some prize while others will only care about winning outright.
There is nothing wrong with sharing many of these motivations, but in a serious game never forget to focus only on what matters: The expected value of your play in terms of chips and dollars.
Rationality
Start at science and god not real then realize have to 
Hack Brain to be rational, built for survival etc 
Brains from natural selection, if you want to see truth, have to figure out how to use brain 
Knowing the math isn’t useful if you are biased and use bad judgment in conjunction with the odds and math
Betting way to show rationality 
Probability range
Rationalism: The art of figuring out what is happening, thinking logically, how to model world. Then make decisions on that basis. 
Thinking.l clearly. Think about how things really work and engage. 
Systematic modeling and decisions, decision theory and Bayes
Intuitive vs rational, notice vibes and update associates vibes I tuitions in that direction and works pretty well. Trying to be rational yields confusion since have to be more curious or say current systems not working. Poker could be basic thinking like winning or losing call or fold rather than full analysis. Rationality in dating? Correlation vs causation. Still have to include intuitions! Combine rationality with intuition! Stop to think about consequences and expected value
Could call this The Straights after The Sequences
Combine rational EV stuff and vibes/intuition
