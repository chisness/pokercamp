# Poker Math -- Expected Value
The expected value of an action is the sum of the value of each potential outcome multiplied by the probability of that outcome occurring. 

## Dice EV
The first EV example is often dice and we will conform. If you are rolling a six-sided standard die, then the possibilities are: 

| Die Roll    | Probability |
| -------- | ------- |
| $1$  | $1/6$    |
| $2$ | $1/6$     |
| $3$    | $1/6$   |
| $4$  | $1/6$    |
| $5$ | $1/6$     |
| $6$    | $1/6$    |

Therefore the expected value of a single die roll is: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= 1*1/6 + 2*1/6 + 3*1/6 + 4*1/6 + 5*1/6 + 6*1/6 \\
  &= 3.5
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$


## Technical Definition
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value): "The expected value of a random variable with a finite number of outcomes is a weighted average of all possible outcomes". 

Mathematically, with a random variable $X$ and a list of possible outcomes $x_1, ..., x_k$ each of which has probability $p_1, ..., p_k$ of occurring, respectively. Then $\mathbb{E}[X] = x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2 + ... + x_k p_k$. 

What is a random variable? It represents possible outcomes. A random variable is defined by its possible outcomes and the probability of each outcome.

There’s a lot of reasons many have made this calculation mistake. We daydream about the universes where we get what we want. The math seems like it should be more “fair” aka “gambler’s fallacy” when it actually has no feelings. 

Our intuition is also bad because of doubles (combinatorics). Every poker player knows we are about  35% to hit a flush draw from flop to river. But “bad math” done from scratch could erroneously show it to be ~38% (19% chance on turn and river each) 

Where did the 3% disappear to? It is lost to the times we get what we want on *BOTH* streets since the sixth diamond is superfluous. 

opportunity cost
comparative advantage
As its name suggests, opportunity cost refers to the cost of choosing one opportunity over others. This “cost” reflects the value you could have gained in all the options you didn’t pursue.

Accounting for opportunity cost can help us understand the comparative value of our available options and spend our time, money, and effort more effectively. This is particularly important for avoiding spending limited resources on an option that seems attractive at first (because it has positive expected value) but will actually give you much worse value than another available option.

In practice, it may not be clear which action will end up being the most valuable. Yet even if you’re unsure, putting some extra thought into its opportunity cost can help you gain an intuition for what actions to prioritize. To do so, figure out which options are available to you, try to determine the overall value of each option, then see how they compare.
