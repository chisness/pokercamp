# AI Poker Camp Beta Jul 8-Aug 8 IRL in SF 

The first ever AI Poker Camp (beta) will take place in person in San Francisco for 5 weeks starting Jul 8 and ending Aug 8. 

Each week will have evening meetings on Mondays and Thursdays from 6:00-8:00pm. 

Location is TBD in San Francisco

## About the Camp

In 2017, [an AI poker bot beat some of the best human players in a 1v1 match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libratus#2017_humans_versus_AI_match). Our camp will begin by learning about the algorithm behind that bot. 

The camp is centered around 6 projects that challenge you to think strategically about making decisions under uncertainty. 

The projects involve a variety of game formats from poker to rock paper scissors to unusual hybrid games. We’ll learn about both game theory optimal strategies and opponent modeling to build strategies against a population of agents with varying skill. 

The expected time commitment is about 10 hours per week including 4 hours per week of in-person meetings.
