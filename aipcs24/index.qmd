Welcome to AI Poker Camp Summer 2024 Beta in San Francisco! 

too quick or too slowly 

Thanks for signing up. This is the first time we're running AI Poker Camp and it's very much in beta. The idea to run this course has existed for a few years, but this curriculum is very new and came about from a discussion at Manifest. 

We're glad to have you along for the ride and welcome any feedback about all aspects of the course. 

We're running this under the flipped classroom model, where we spend the majority of the time in the sessions focused on thinking about and getting started on the challenge problems, and time outside the sessions doing readings and further work on the challenge problems. 

Readings like this one highlight concepts that are relevant to the accompanying challenge. 

Our goal is to develop your intuitions around decision making and problem solving by engaging with challenges in fun and non-idealized scenarios.
