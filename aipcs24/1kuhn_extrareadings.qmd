## Concept: Nash Equilibrium
A Nash equililibrium is a set of strategies for both players such that neither player ever plays an action with regret (when they take those strategies as given). The other paradigm for game strategies is opponent exploitation, which we will address in future sections. 

Recall that regret only makes sense in the context of a particular strategy and assumed opponent’s strategy. When you submit a strategy to Challenge 1, you submit a strategy for being P1, and a strategy for being P2, but you won’t ever play against yourself – so why is it helpful to find a pair that plays against itself without regret?

### Indifference and Penalty Kicks
Consider the **Soccer Penalty Kick** game where a Kicker is trying to score a goal and the Goalie is trying to block it. 

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left | Lean Right | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left  | 0, 0  | +2, -2 |
| Kick Right | +1, -1 | 0, 0|

The game setup is zero-sum. If Kicker and Goalie both go in one direction, then it’s assumed that the goal will miss and both get $0$ payoffs. If the Kicker plays Kick Right when the Goalie plays Lean Left, then the Kicker is favored and gets a payoff of $+1$. If the Kicker plays Kick Left when the Goalie plays Lean Right, then the kicker is even more favored, because it’s easier to kick left than right, and gets $+2$.

## Nash Equilibrium Exercise

Which of these, if any, is a Nash Equilibrium? You can check by seeing if either player would benefit by changing their action. 

| Kicker | Goalie | Equilibrium or Change? | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Left  | Left  |  |
| Left | Right | |
| Right | Left | |
| Right | Right | |

## Solution

There are no pure Nash equilibrium solutions because when the actions match, the Kicker will always want to change, and when they don’t match, the Goalie will always want to change. 

| Kicker | Goalie | Equilibrium or Change? | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Left  | Left  | Kicker changes to right  |
| Left | Right | Goalie changes to left |
| Right | Left | Goalie changes to right |
| Right | Right | Kicker changes to left |

## Expected Value Exercise
Assume that they both play Left 50% and Right 50% -- what is the expected value of the game? 

:::

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Solution

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left (0.5) | Lean Right (0.5) | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left (0.5) | 0, 0  | +2, -2 |
| Kick Right (0.5) | +1, -1 | 0, 0|

We apply these probabilities to each of the 4 outcomes: 

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left (0.5) | Lean Right (0.5) | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left (0.5) | 0, 0 (0.25) | +2, -2 (0.25) |
| Kick Right (0.5) | +1, -1 (0.25) | 0, 0 (0.25) |

Now for the Kicker, we have $\mathbb{E} = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2 + 0.25*1 + 0.25*0 = 0.75$. 

Since it's zero-sum, we have $\mathbb{E} = -0.75$ for the Goalie.

Note that, for example, the Kicker playing 50% Left and 50% Right could be interpreted as a single player having these probabilities or a field of players averaging to these probabilities. So out of 100 players, this could mean: 

- 100 players playing 50% Left and 50% Right
- 50 players playing 100% Left and 50 players playing 100% Right
- 50 players playing 75% Left/25% Right and 50 players playing 25% Left/75% right

:::

When the Goalie plays left with probability $p$ and right with probability $1-p$, we can find the expected value of the Kicker actions.

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left (p) | Lean Right (1-p) | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left | 0, 0  | +2, -2 |
| Kick Right | +1, -1 | 0, 0|

$\mathbb{E}(\text{Kick Left}) = 0*p + 2*(1-p) = 2 - 2*p$

$\mathbb{E}(\text{Kick Right}) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = 1*p$

The Kicker is going to play the best response to the Goalie’s strategy. The Goalie wants to make the Kicker **indifferent** to Kick Left and Kick Right because if the Kicker was not going to be indifferent, then he would prefer one of the actions, meaning that action would be superior to the other. Therefore the Kicker will play a mixed strategy in response that will result in a Nash equilibrium where neither player benefits from unilaterally changing strategies. (Note that indifferent does not mean 50% each, but means the expected value is the same for each.)

![](assets/kickergoalieplot.png)

By setting the values equal, we get $2 - 2*p = 1*p \Rightarrow p = \frac{2}{3}$ as shown in the plot. This means that $1-p = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore the Goalie should play Lean Left $\frac{2}{3}$ and Lean Right $\frac{1}{3}$. The value for the Kicker is $\frac{2}{3}$, or $(0.67)$, for both actions, regardless of the Kicker's mixing strategy. 

Note that the Kicker is worse off now ($0.67$ now compared to $0.75$) than when both players played 50% each action. Why?

If the Kicker plays Left with probability $q$ and Right with probability $1-q$, then the Goalie’s values are: 

$\mathbb{E}(\text{Lean Left}) = 0*q - 1*(1-q) = -1 + q$

$\mathbb{E}(\text{Lean Right}) = -2*q + 0 = -2*q$

Setting equal, 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-1 + q &= -2*q \\
-1 &= -3*q  \\
\frac{1}{3} &= q
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore the Kicker should play Left $\frac{1}{3}$ and Right $\frac{2}{3}$, giving a value of $-\frac{2}{3}$ to the Goalie. 

We can see this from the game table: 

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left ($\frac{2}{3}$) | Lean Right ($\frac{1}{3}$) | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left ($\frac{1}{3}$) | 0, 0 ($\frac{2}{9}$) | +2, -2 ($\frac{1}{9}$) |
| Kick Right ($\frac{2}{3}$) | +1, -1 ($\frac{4}{9}$) | 0, 0 ($\frac{2}{9}$)|

Therefore the expected payoffs in this game are $\frac{2}{9}*0 + \frac{1}{9}*2 + \frac{4}{9}*1 + \frac{2}{9}*0 = \frac{6}{9} = 0.67$ for the Kicker and $-0.67$ for the Goalie. 

In an equilibrium, no player should be able to unilaterally improve by changing their strategy. What if the Kicker switches to always Kick Left?

| Kicker/Goalie | Lean Left ($\frac{2}{3}$) | Lean Right ($\frac{1}{3}$) | 
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Kick Left ($1$) | 0, 0 ($\frac{2}{3}$) | +2, -2 ($\frac{1}{3}$) |
| Kick Right ($0$) | +1, -1 ($0$) | 0, 0 ($0$)|

Now the Kicker's payoff is still $\frac{1}{3}*2 = 0.67$. 

When a player makes their opponent indifferent, this means that any action the opponent takes (within the set of equilibrium actions) will result in the same payoff! 

So if you know your opponent is playing the equilibrium strategy, then you can actually do whatever you want with no penalty with the mixing actions. Sort of. 

The risk is that the opponent can now deviate from equilibrium and take advantage of your new strategy. For example, if the Goalie caught on and moved to always Lean Left, then expected value is reduced to $0$ for both players. 

To summarize, you can only be penalized for not playing the equilibrium mixing strategy if your opponent plays a non-equilibrium strategy that exploits your strategy.

## Indifference
Why do players make their opponent indifferent?
:::

## Indifference in Poker 
Back to poker. We can apply this indifference principle in computing equilibrium strategies in poker. When you make your opponent indifferent, then you don’t give them any best play. 

If you play an equilibrium strategy, opponents will only get penalized for playing hands outside of the set of hands in the mixed strategy equilibrium (also known as the support, or the set of pure strategies that are played with non-zero probability under the mixed strategy). If opponents are not playing equilibrium, though, then they open themselves up to exploitation. 

Let’s look at one particular situation in Kuhn Poker and work it out by hand. Suppose that you are Player 2 with card Q after a Check from Player 1.

![](assets/kuhnindiff.png)

:::{.callout-note  appearance="minimal"}
## Expected Value Exercise
What indifference is Player 2 trying to induce? 

:::

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Solution
Making P1 indifferent between calling and folding with a K 
:::

We can work out Player 2's betting strategy by calculating the indifference. Let $b$ be the probability that P2 bets with a Q after P1 checks. 


$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\text{P1 Check K then Fold to Bet}) &= 0 \\
\\

\mathbb{E}(\text{P1 Check K then Call Bet}) &= -1*\Pr(\text{P2 has A and Bets}) + 3*\Pr(\text{P2 has Q and Bets}) \\
  &= -1*\frac{1}{2} + 3*\frac{1}{2}*b \\
  &= -0.5 + 1.5*b
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Setting these equal: 

$0 = -0.5 + 1.5*b$ 

$b = \frac{1}{3}$

Therefore in equilibrium, P2 should bet $\frac{1}{3}$ with Q after P1 checks.

## Equilibrium Mixed Strategy Change Exercise
If P2 bet $\frac{2}{3}$ instead of $\frac{1}{3}$ with Q after P1 checks and P1 is playing an equilibrium strategy, how would P2’s expected value change? 

NOTE: Put the strategy boxes here? 

:::

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Solution
It wouldn't! As long as P1 doesn't modify their strategy, then P2 can mix his strategy however he wants and have the same EV. 

:::

:::{.callout-note  appearance="minimal"}
## Bluff:Value Ratio Exercise
Given that P2 has bet after P1 checks and is playing the equilibrium strategy, what is the probability that they are bluffing?

(Note: Including cases where you have an A, so Q bets are bluffs and A bets are value bets.)

:::

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Solution
P2 has Q and A each $\frac{1}{2}$ of the time. 

P2 is betting Q $\frac{1}{3}$ of the time (bluffing). 

P2 is betting A always (value betting). 

Therefore for every 3 times you have Q you will bet once and for every 3 times you have A you will bet 3 times. Out of the 4 bets, 1 of them is a bluff. 

$\Pr(\text{P2 Bluff after P1 Check}) = \frac{1}{4}$

## TO DO BELOW 

TO DO: 
- What if the bet size was 2 instead of 1?

- Can you come up with a general formula for how often to bluff given a pot and bet size? 

- Range of hands vs. range of hands vs. your hand vs. their strategy. Different if their strategy never changes.  

- What is a creative strategy to try against a player who studies poker and is trying to play an equilibrium strategy, but might be open to changing their strategy? Bet sizes they haven’t studied, do something crazy and then counterexploit?

- Node locking question 


In what case could we deduce our opponent’s strategy with a large sample size? Note: We can assume that they are playing the pure strategy decisions correctly. 

For example, if we as P1 Check with K, we can know how often they’re betting Q since we know they’ll always bet A. 

Over a sample of 1000 hands that we Check with K, we expect that 500 times they would have Q and 500 times they would have A. We expect that they would always bet with A and bet some percentage $p$ of their Q hands. 

Formula for how often they’re betting Q. 

What’s another case we could determine? Bet Q, how often call/fold K. How to use this?
