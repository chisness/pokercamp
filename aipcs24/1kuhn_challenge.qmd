## Kuhn Poker
Kuhn Poker is the most simple version of poker. Here is the setup: 

- 3 card deck: Queen, King, Ace (in ascending order, so Ace is highest)

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"  appearance="minimal"}
## Alternative Decks 

  - Any deck of 3 ranked cards works

  - This could be numbers like {0, 1, 2} or other cards like {Jack, Queen, King}
:::

- 2 players

- Each player starts with 2 <abbr title="Betting currency -- the goal is to win these">chips</abbr> and <abbr title="An ante is a forced bet">antes</abbr> 1 chip

- Deal 1 card to each player (discard the third)

![](assets/kuhn.png)

- There is one betting round in which players can take these actions: 

  - Up ↑ (putting a chip into the pot) 
  
  - Down ↓ (not putting a chip into the pot) 

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"  appearance="minimal"}
## Poker Terms for Actions 

  - Up ↑ actions indicate a <abbr title="Add chips to pot that others have to match">Bet</abbr> or <abbr title="Match an opponent bet">Call</abbr>

  - Down ↓ actions indicate a <abbr title="Pass, only possible when no one has made a bet">Check</abbr> or <abbr title="Surrender when facing a bet">Fold</abbr>
:::

Example betting round: 

- ![](assets/p1l.png) Player 1: Up ↑ (1 chip into pot)

- ![](assets/p2w.png) Player 2: Up ↑ (1 chip into pot)

- High Card wins +2 (+1 from the ante, +1 from the ↑ bet)

- If ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 has card A and ![](assets/p2w.png)P2 has card K, ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 wins

### Get Started with Kuhn 
- Play a few hands

- Get used to the game setup

- Think about which situations are automatic and which are not

## Interactive Site
Visit the [interactive Kuhn site](https://static.rossry.net/sketches/poker/kuhn3/). The site shows the game tree for Kuhn Poker at the top and the 12 information sets of the game at the bottom. 

### Interactive Site Kuhn Tree
Recall that an information set is a set of nodes that contain the same information for the corresponding player. For example, a ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 K_ node indicates that ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 has card K and no other actions have occurred (if actions had occurred they would be shown in the infoset as ↑ or ↓). 

This information set represents both the node where ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 has K and ![](assets/p2w.png) P2 has A and the node where ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 has K and ![](assets/p2w.png) P2 has Q, but since ![](assets/p1l.png) P1 cannot distinguish between these, they are grouped into one information set.

### Play
Spend a few minutes playing with the strategy probabilities to see how they affect the rest of the tree.

Recall the two types of uncertainty: 

1. About which node we are actually in, which depends on probabilities upwards in the game tree

2. About what happens after an action, which depends on the probabilities downwards in the game tree

## Challenge 1
The goal of this challenge is to find optimal strategies for Kuhn Poker by adjusting the individual strategies at each of the 12 infosets (6 for each player). Optimal here means Nash equilibrium regret-minimizing strategies for both players. 

By adjusting strategies for both players, we can find an equilibrium and then 

### Part 1: Submit Manual Strategies
Set the 12 strategies to percentages that you think are best. 

Hint: There are some "automatic" infoset strategies such that it only makes sense to play 100% of one action in the game. 

TODO: Time limit? Do this in session and other outside? 

### Part 2: Submit Automatic Strategies
After submitting the manual strategies, you will move to the automatic page in which you can update the strategies by selecting different algorithmic methods, iterations, and speeds. 

#### Why can’t we just do tree search?

Because of incomplete information.

If we had complete information, then the regret-minimizing strategy downstream of a node would depend only on stuff downtree of that node, and we could – in theory – compute the strategy recursively from the bottom up.

If you attempt to follow this strategy in Kuhn poker, it will fail. You can try this for yourself – if it was valid to “solve from the bottom up”, then the following steps should get to a regret-minimal strategy: 

1. Reset
2. Update the strategy weights for the X_↓↑ nodes until they converge.
3. Update the strategy weights for the _X↓ and _X↑ nodes until they converge.
4. Update the strategy weights for the X_ nodes until they converge.

Follow these steps. You do not have a regret-minimal strategy. Why not? What went wrong? 

#### Do we really need mixed strategies?

You can test this for yourself. If you set the learning rate to 1.0, updating a cell will move it all the way to playing the locally better action 100% of the time.

Follow these steps:

1. Reset
2. Set the learning rate to 1.0.
3. In any order you like, pick cells and update them.
4. Repeat 3 while there are still suboptimal moves in your strategy.

A bad thing is happening to you. Why?

#### Find Strategies
Update the strategies until they converge and submit the strategy. 

### Challenge 1 Results
Parts 1 and 2 will each generate and submit a bot that plays with your chosen probabilities. (It has no memory of other rounds, and plays each round based on the probabilities.) 

Your submission will play 100,000 times against all other submissions (including 10 bots that we added to start the challenge). It will play as P1 half the time and P2 half the time. Each 1v1 will be played in duplicate so that the card dealings are reversed to reduce variance. 

After a short delay, the leaderboard should update; your score will be compared to other players and selected bots. You will be listed as “tied” with another entry if your total score against all opponents is within one standard error of theirs.
