## What the K?
During the first AI Poker Camp session on Monday 7/15/24, we asked participants to list the deterministic situations in the Kuhn Poker game. In other words, points of the game where it is strictly best to play a certain action. 

We started with the full game tree:

![](assets/kuhn_tree.png)

We came up with a list of 5 of these: 

| #  | Scenario | Action |
|----|----------|--------|
| 1  | <span class="infoset p2">_Q↑</span>: <span class="gamenode">Q</span> as Player 2 facing a bet | Should always play <span class="gamenode">↓</span> fold |
| 2  | <span class="infoset p2">_A↑</span>: <span class="gamenode">A</span> as Player 2 facing a bet | Should always play <span class="gamenode">↑</span> call |
| 3  | <span class="infoset p2">_A↓</span>: <span class="gamenode">A</span> as Player 2 facing a check | Should always play <span class="gamenode">↑</span> bet |
| 4  | <span class="infoset p1">Q_↓↑</span>: <span class="gamenode">Q</span> as Player 1 checking and then facing a bet | Should always play <span class="gamenode">↓</span> fold |
| 5  | <span class="infoset p1">A_↓↑</span>: <span class="gamenode">A</span> as Player 2 checking and then facing a bet | Should always play <span class="gamenode">↑</span> bet |

The game tree is then reduced to: 

![](assets/kuhn_tree_prune.png)

There are 2 others that we knew were slightly different, but we still believed that they belonged in this category: 

| #  | Scenario | Action |
|----|----------|--------|
| 6  | <span class="infoset p2">K_↓</span>: <span class="gamenode">K</span> as Player 2 facing a check |  |
| 7  | <span class="infoset p1">K_</span>: <span class="gamenode">K</span> as Player 1 acting first |  |

My assumption was that 6 and 7 were trickier because they relied on the opponent playing under the conditions of 1-5 above. Things turned around and I became the confused one when a couple of participants pointed out that at <span class="infoset p1">K_</span> it is not always clearly best to play <span class="gamenode">↓</span>! 

Betting with a <span class="gamenode">K</span> knowing that your opponent will always play perfectly (fold with <span class="gamenode">Q</span> and call with <span class="gamenode">A</span>) does not seem intuitively very profitable, but this exercise is asking for *deterministic* situations where it is definitely best to play one action. 

Going forward on this page, we are assuming that players play their mandatory +EV decisions correctly (i.e., numbers 1-5 above). 

## <span class="infoset p2">_K↓</span>
<!-- There is a claim that <span class="player p2"></span> should always play <span class="gamenode">↓</span>.  -->
We are looking at TPOT (this part of the tree) when <span class="player p2"></span> has a <span class="gamenode">K</span> and is facing a <span class="gamenode">↓</span> (check):

![](assets/kuhn_tree_kp2d.png)

If playing <span class="gamenode">↑</span>, we have: 
$$
\mathbb{E} = -2*\Pr(\text{P1 A Plays \downarrow}) + 1*\Pr(\text{P1 Q Plays \downarrow})
$$

Playing <span class="gamenode">↓</span> has: 
$$
\mathbb{E} = -1*\Pr(\text{P1 A Plays \downarrow}) + 1*\Pr(\text{P1 Q Plays \downarrow})
$$

Therefore in this case <span class="gamenode">↓</span> *is* strictly best and we can include this case on our list of deterministic situations. 

The updated tree: 

![](assets/kuhn_tree_prune_2.png)

<!-- When would <span class="gamenode">↑</span> do better?

Only when <span class="player p1"></span> plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span> with <span class="gamenode">Q</span> or <span class="gamenode">↓</span> with <span class="gamenode">A</span>.  -->

## <span class="infoset p1">K_</span>
We are now looking at TPOT (this part of the tree) and can end up on one of these 7 nodes:

![](assets/kuhn_tree_kp1.png)

At infoset <span class="infoset p1">K_</span>, when the <span class="gamenode">K</span> opening action plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span>, we end up in 2 possible nodes and have known EV: 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} &= -2*\Pr(\text{P2 has A}) + 1*\Pr(\text{P2 has Q}) \\
&= -2*0.5 + 1*0.5 \\
&= -0.5
\end{align}
$$

Now things get interesting. 

When the <span class="gamenode">K</span> opening action plays <span class="gamenode">↓</span>, we can compute the EV: 

1. Assume that <span class="player p1"></span> plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span> at <span class="infoset p1">K↓↑</span> with probability $k$. 

2. Assume that <span class="player p2"></span> plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span> at <span class="infoset p2">_Q↓</span> with probability $q$. 

There are 3 cases of what can happen now after <span class="player p1"></span> plays <span class="gamenode">↓</span> at <span class="infoset p1">K_</span> and we can end up in 5 possible nodes: 

1. <span class="player p2"></span> has <span class="gamenode">A</span> and plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span>. 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} &= -2*\Pr(\text{P1 Calls K}) - 1*\Pr(\text{P1 Folds K}) \\
&= -2*k - 1*(1-k) \\
&= -k - 1
\end{align}
$$

2. <span class="player p2"></span> has <span class="gamenode">Q</span> and plays <span class="gamenode">↓</span>.

$$
\mathbb{E} = 1
$$

3. <span class="player p2"></span> has <span class="gamenode">Q</span> and plays <span class="gamenode">↑</span>.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} &= 2*\Pr(\text{P1 Calls K}) - 1*\Pr(\text{P1 Folds K}) \\
&= 2*k - 1*(1-k) \\
&= 3*k - 1
\end{align}
$$

Putting these together, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} &= [-k - 1]*\Pr(\text{P2 has A}) + [1]*\Pr(\text{P2 has Q and Checks}) + [3*k - 1]*\Pr(\text{P2 Has Q and Bets}) \\
&= [-k - 1]*0.5 + [1]*0.5*(1-q) + [3*k - 1]*0.5*(q) \\
&= -0.5*k - 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.5*q + 1.5*k*q - 0.5*q \\
&= -0.5*k - q + 1.5*k*q
\end{align}
$$

    ]
  })
}

```

<!-- ### How do the K situations differ? -->


### Mathematical Conclusions
We can set $-0.5 = -0.5*k - q + 1.5*k*q$ to compare the EV of betting to checking. 

We see that if you have check and then call with at least $k \geq 0.5$ then you do at least as good as betting. You do strictly better if $0.5 < k < 1$. 

<!-- ## Poker

How does this apply to a real poker situation? 

Suppose that you get to the river with QhJs on a board of Jh8h6d3s2s. 

Suppose that the pot is 100 and you have 100 in chips against one opponent who also has 100 chips.  -->



<!-- real poker situation where you go allin and don't give opponent chance to bluff, but make it easier on yourself -->


This saddle-point visualization is actually really good for me. I feel like I more-intuitively understand that:
changing q changes the slope of the line in the k axis, and also the setting that's flat optimizes minimax
when we pick q so that the line is flat in the k axis, P1 still gets to pick among k values that cause P2 to face a different slope 
If P1 plays a positive p(⬇️|A_), then that gives P2 an incentive to push q down, which is like adding another gradient along the q axis
...I forget where I was going with this, but it feels helpful

Potential improvements: 
above the q slider, write "when k is [current value], z = [formula in q]"
above the k slider, write "when q is [current value], z = [formula in k]"
on the 3d plot, draw a red dot at the current q, k and a red line along the line that varies k from there, and along the line that varies q from there
have an option to switch to a 2d plot with: (subplot 1) z,k where q is represented by color/hue, draw 11 lines for every 0.1 increment of q with opacity 30%, then the line for the current q with opacity 100%; (subplot 2) z,q where k is represented by color
I think it might be better to swap the axes of the 3d plot because q happens logically before k, but I'm not sure and the shape might look worse
I'm not sure about the q,k axes direction -- is it better if 0,0 is the point closest to us? (this might make the shape look bad because we look at it edge-on)
can we get a 3d graphing library that lets you click and drag to rotate?
I went down my own k-hole to figure out that z=(3q-1)(3k-2)/6+1/3, which I think should be presented somewhere?
I think the 3d graph (and the 2d graphs) should do more to make clear where -0.5 is, since that's the case we're comparing it to.
