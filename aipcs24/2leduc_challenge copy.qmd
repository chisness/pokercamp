## Leduc Poker Rules
Leduc Poker is a simple toy poker game invented at the University of Alberta. 

Here is the setup: 

- 6 card deck: 2 Queens, 2 Kings, 2 Aces (in ascending order, so Ace is highest)

- Leduc Poker is played with 2 players. We'll again use <span class="player p1"></span> and <span class="player p2"></span>.

- Each player antes 1 chip

- Deal 1 card to each player

- Betting round 1: 
  - There is a fixed bet size of 2 chips
  - There is a maximum of 2 bets per round (i.e. a bet and a raise)

- Deal a face up community card
  - Players make the best 2 card hand combining their card and the community card, meaning a pair is the best possible hand

- Betting round 2: 
  - There is a fixed bet size of 4 chips
  - There is a maximum of 2 bets per round (i.e. a bet and a raise)

- Notes: 
  - Player 1 acts first, rotate who is Player 1 each hand
  - Players can win/lose a maximum of 13 chips per hand

- Infosets and payoffs 

![](assets/kuhn.png)
  - <span class=action>↑Up</span> (putting a chip into the pot) 
  
  - <span class=action>↓Down</span> (not putting a chip into the pot) 

:::{.callout-tip  appearance="minimal"}
## <span class=action>↑Up</span> and <span class=action>↓Down</span> in traditional poker terms

  - <span class=action>↑Up</span> actions indicate a <abbr title="To 'bet' is to add chips to the pot that others have to match (or fold). To 'raise' is to put in a larger amount than your opponent's bet, to force them to match your higher amount (or fold). In Kuhn Poker there are no raises because each player only has 1 chip to bet with.">Bet</abbr> or <abbr title="To 'call' is to match an opponent's bet.">Call</abbr>.

  - <span class=action>↓Down</span> actions indicate a <abbr title="To 'check' is to pass, which is usually only possible when no one has made a bet in this street.">Check</abbr> or <abbr title="To 'fold' is to surrender when facing a bet, losing all chips you have put in so far.">Fold</abbr>.

:::{.callout-note  appearance="minimal"}
## Example game
- Players ante and cards are dealt.

- <span class="player p1"></span> sees a <span class="gamenode">A</span> and plays <span class=action>↑Up</span> (1 more chip into pot).

- <span class="player p2"></span> sees a <span class="gamenode">K</span> and plays <span class=action>↑Up</span> (1 more chip into pot).

- Both cards are revealed in a 2-chip showdown. <span class="player p1"></span> has an <span class="gamenode">A</span> and <span class="player p2"></span> has a <span class="gamenode">K</span>.

- <span class="player p1"></span> has the better hand and wins +2 chips (+1 from the ante, +1 from <span class="player p2"></span>'s <span class=action>↑Up</span>).
:::

The betting (and the game) can go in three ways: 

1. One player plays <span class=action>↑Up</span>, then the other player plays <span class=action>↓Down</span>. The player who played <span class=action>↓Down</span> <abbr title="To 'fold' is to surrender when facing a bet, losing all chips you have put in so far.">folds</abbr>. The winner wins the loser's ante (and gets their own chip back). The players' cards are not revealed. Note that this happens if the action is : 
  - <span class=action>↑Up</span>, <span class=action>↓Down</span>, or 
  - <span class=action>↓Down</span>, <span class=action>↑Up</span>, <span class=action>↓Down</span>.

2. Both players play <span class=action>↓Down</span>. They go to a <abbr title="In a 'showdown', all remaining players show their cards and the best hand wins. (In Kuhn Poker, the better hand is just the higher card.)">showdown</abbr> and the winner wins the one chip that the loser anted (and their own back).

3. A player plays <span class=action>↑Up</span>, then the other player plays <span class=action>↑Up</span>. They go to a showdown and the winner wins the two chips the loser has put in the pot (and gets their own chips back). Note that the game will proceed to a 2-chip showdown if the action is:
  - <span class=action>↑Up</span>, <span class=action>↑Up</span> or - <span class=action>↓Down</span>, <span class=action>↑Up</span> , <span class=action>↑Up</span>.

Here is a list of all possible betting sequences:  

| <span class="player p1"></span>  | <span class="player p2"></span>  | <span class="player p1"></span> | Winner       |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| <span class=action>↑Up</span>        | <span class=action>↓Down</span>      |          |<span class="player p1"></span> (+1) |
| <span class=action>↑Up</span>        | <span class=action>↑Up</span>        |          |Higher Card (+2)|
| <span class=action>↓Down</span>     | <span class=action>↓Down</span>      |          |Higher Card (+1)|
| <span class=action>↓Down</span>      | <span class=action>↑Up</span>        | <span class=action>↓Down</span>     |<span class="player p2"></span> (+1) |
| <span class=action>↓Down</span>      | <span class=action>↑Up</span>        | <span class=action>↑Up</span>       |Higher Card (+2)|

## Partner Exercise: Get started with Kuhn Poker

- Get cards, chips, paper, pen

- Play 3 hands of Kuhn Poker and get used to how the game runs

- Use the pen and paper to start writing down all deterministic situations in the game (situations where there is clearly a correct move that you should take 100% of the time)

- Play more hands as you think helpful

- Once you have what you think is a full list of the deterministic states, you can stop and review the [optional reading](1kuhn_reading.html)

Pure strategies in perfect info games vs. mixed in imperfect info

Deterministic Nature: Because all players can see the entire game state and know all possible moves, strategies can be deterministic. Players can calculate and choose the optimal move based on this complete information.
Pure Strategies: A pure strategy is a complete plan of action for every possible situation in a game. In perfect information games, players can follow a pure strategy because they know exactly what will happen as a result of each possible move.

Uncertainty and Hidden Information: Because players cannot see the entire game state, they must account for uncertainty and the hidden information of their opponents. This makes the game more about probabilities and expectations rather than certainties.
Mixed Strategies: A mixed strategy involves randomizing over possible moves to prevent opponents from exploiting predictable patterns. By using mixed strategies, players can become less predictable and make it more difficult for opponents to formulate a counter-strategy.

Strategic Randomization: In games like poker, where bluffing and deception play significant roles, mixed strategies are essential. For example, a player might choose to bluff (make a bet with a weak hand) with a certain probability to keep opponents guessing and to avoid being exploited by always playing in a predictable manner.

(Ross note: The difference between “Chance” and “Imperfect Info” is that in Chance, the unknown [thing] doesn’t affect anything about the world until it becomes known, and then it’s not unknown any more. In Imperfect Info, the information has some effect on the world at time T1, then you need to make a decision at time T2, then the information will matter at some later point T3.)

What makes poker and other games in the bottom right of the table interesting?

## Simulator

Random, reward avg, etc. 

Describe the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma.
Introduce basic strategies: epsilon-greedy, UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), and Thompson Sampling.

Record the results and display them in real-time (either through the program or manually on a board).
Strategy Discussion:

After a few rounds, pause and discuss the strategies teams are using.
Introduce the different algorithms and how they would approach the problem.

Algorithm Implementation:

Allow teams to adopt one of the introduced algorithms for the next rounds.
Compare the performance of different algorithms in terms of accumulated rewards.
